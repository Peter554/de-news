Search the internet for todays top news.

I'm especially interested in:
- Global news
- UK news
- German news
- Berlin & Brandenburg news

Select 3-5 top articles.

For each article:
* Create a simple German text (B1 level text) of roughly 250 words.
* For each sentence in the text, provide an English translation.
* Provide a key vocab list.
* Provide links to the original source articles, where one could go to read more.

For each article, create a JSON file for the result under `articles/$today`, where `$today` is todays date (ISO format). Each JSON file should obey the schema given in `article-schema.json`.
