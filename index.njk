    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To create some extra reading practice for myself to improve my German.
            I've been inspired by tools like <a href="https://readle-app.com/">Readle</a>
            and sites like <a href="https://www.nachrichtenleicht.de/">nachrichtenleicht</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            To experiment with AI, both in terms of content generation and coding assistance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Creating a comprehensive and balanced news experience has not been the goal of this project,
        so treat the generated content with caution.

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        AI (<a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a>) searches the web to fetch top news stories and then
        creates article summaries in simple German (roughly B1 level) with translations, vocabulary lists and tags.
        This process runs daily via a GitHub actions workflow with a CRON schedule.
        AI then makes a daily PR with the new articles and assigns me for review.
        The articles are then published via a simple <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> site deployed to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.
